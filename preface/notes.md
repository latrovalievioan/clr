## 1.1 Algorithms

An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure
that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces
some value, or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus
a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.


How to define formally a problem(sorting): 

Input: A sequence of n numbers(a1,a2,....,an)
Output: A permutation (reordering) (a'1, a'2,.....a'n) of the input sequence
such that a'1 <= a'2 <= ... <= a'n.
