# 1.2 Analyzing algorithms

In general, the time taken by an algorithm grows with the size of the input,
so it is traditional to describe the running time of a program as a function
of the size of its input. To do so we need a carefull definition of "running time"
and "size of input".

## Size of input
The input size depends on the problem being studied.

For sorting algorithms it would make sense that the input size is the
number of items in the input.
E.g: `sort([1,2,3,4])` - the input size is 4.

For many other problems such as multiplying two integers, the best
measure of input size is the total number of bits needed to represent the input
in ordinary binary notation.
E.g: `multiply(2,4)` - the input size is 5 (2 -> 10, 4 -> 100)


## Running time
The running time of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of primitive
operations or "steps" executed.
