# Algorithms

Informally, an algorithm is any well-de没ned computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
output in a 没nite amount of time. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational
steps that transform the input into the output.

As an example, suppose that you need to sort a sequence of numbers into monotonically increasing order. 
This problem arises frequently in practice and provides
fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools.
Here is how we formally de没ne the sorting problem:

`Input:` A sequence of n numbers (a1, a2, ..., an)
`Output:` A reordering of the input sequence such that a1 <= a2 <= ... <=an

## Data structures

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to 
facilitate access and modi没cations.
